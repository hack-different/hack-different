# Overview

A community built around all jailbreaks, reverse engineering and security for Apple products.  It
was created by the core [checkra1n](https://checkra.in) team but is owned by the community (in part due to `checkm8`
being a useful tool for research for years to come).

### [Hacky](https://bot.hackdiffe.rent) - The Poor Man's Jarvis

Hacky is our snarky bot for the Discord server.  It is open source, documented at
[https://bot.hackdiffe.rent](https://bot.hackdiffe.rent) and the code is hosted at
[hack-different/hacky-bot](https://github.com/hack-different/hacky-bot).

### Rules

Writing out some rules:

> 0. Use common sense and behave yourself.
> 0. No "drama" (i.e. arguments that do not seek a solution).
> 0. This is NOT a jailbreak support server. Do not ask for customer support here.
> 0. This should be obvious, but no dealing with illegal material here.
> 0. Do not ask for ETA.
> 0. Do not ask for iCloud lock bypass.
> 0. If an admin or mod asks you to change your behaviour, don't make them ask twice.

Violations may result in either a polite warning, a kick, or a ban at the team's discretion
